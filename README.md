ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Wendy, a recent graduate of The School of Code bootcamp (cohort 15) and an enthusiastic new full stack developer.   In fact, Iâ€™ve been in and around the IT industry throughout my career and was once a mainframe programmer before moving into project management, through CRM consulting and culminating in leading the IT team at a startup.
Going back to coding has been brilliant, if a bit daunting â€“ I have remembered how much I used to enjoy the creative problem solving and am hoping to do plenty more in the future.  Watch this spaceâ€¦..
